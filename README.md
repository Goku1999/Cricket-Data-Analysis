# Cricket-Data-Analysis
This project downloads the raw data from https://cricsheet.org which contains the ball by ball data of every match played since 2006.
It categorizes its downloads as ODI, T20I, Test matches, etc.
The downloaded data was of the format .csv
We have cleaned the downloaded data using file handling in java.
All the other analysis is done in python using matplotlib library as the major library.
The program currently shows the analysis of a particular team, particular player, team vs team info.
The work left as of now is adding the bowler's analysis in program as well as adding gui for a better user interaction.
